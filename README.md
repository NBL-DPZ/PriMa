# PriMa
A low-cost, modular, openhardware, and 3d-printed fMRImanipulandum. Released under the [Cern Open Hardware Licence V2 Version P (CERN-OHL-P)](https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/wikis/home).

All construction files are provided as Fusion 360 archives (f3d) and STEP files. If possible, the fusion files are prefered, as the objects were originally designed in Fusion. The STEP files are provided in case a different CAD software is utelized. However, the STEP export is not checked for export errors (as unlikely as they are).

When using those files please cite as reference:
